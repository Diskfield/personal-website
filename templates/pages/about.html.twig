    <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

    <p>
        I work primarily as a backend developer and tend to gravitate toward systems
        that are powerful, yet boring in the best possible way.
    </p>

    <p>
        I care a lot about readability; I prefer tools that stay out of the way once they've been set up.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of work, I spend quite a bit of time on tabletop RPGs, mostly as a GM. I enjoy the crunch of systems analysis and the kind
        of preparation that happens long before anyone sits down at my table. <span class="muted">Mix that together with telling some very interesting stories,
            and you've got yourself a great game.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm familiar with D&D, but I prefer Call of Cthulhu much more. Both because of the system itself, and because of the story-telling aspect.
        The thrill and danger those kinds of stories tend to bring are exactly what I love about them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Music is another constant. I tend to listen to full albums rather than playlists,
        and my taste leans heavily toward metal and related genres.
    </p>
