            <h1>Music</h1>
            <p>
                I'm an album listener. I like putting on a record front-to-back and letting it breathe, especially when the band actually builds a mood across the tracklist.

            <p>
                Most of my rotation lives somewhere around (the various flavors of) death metal, but I'll happily detour into thrash, punk, and desert/stoner rock when the riffs are right.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm also an amateur sound enthusiast. I don't chase gear endlessly, but I do care about how albums sound. Especially when listening all the way through instead of track-hopping.

            <h2>Listening setup</h2>
            <p>
                My setup is small and practical:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sennheiser HD650</strong> —
                    my go-to for home listening. Comfortable for long sessions and balanced response make for crispy and clear sound overall.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Audio-Technica ATH-M50x</strong> —
                    my portable choice. More durable than people give it credit for, easy to use on the move, and a lot of bang for your buck.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Scarlett 2i2 4th gen</strong> —
                    the little red device that could. Works fantastic as a sound interface for my RØDE NT1 and to listen music through.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>LD Systems HPA4</strong> —
                    the dinky desktop amp. Does its job beautifully and was very cheap when I bought it.
                </li>
            </ul>
