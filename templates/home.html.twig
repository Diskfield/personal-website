            A small personal site about things I care enough to spend time on.
        </p>

        <p>
            This site exists as a quiet hub for longer thoughts, maybe projects, and references in general.
            It's intentionally minimal, built to be readable first and visually calm.
        </p>

        <p>
            You'll find my notes on whatever is on my mind, along with occasional deep dives that don't fit well into social media or chat threads.
